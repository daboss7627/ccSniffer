# ccSniffer
A sniffer for cc1101 chip

This project implements a basic Radio Sniffer based on the TI's cc1101 transceiver.

The firmware runs on a [NanoCUL](https://www.nanocul.de/) device, an arduino NANO 328p cpu board with a cc1101 module.

Actually it outputs any received packets in a machine readable format:
